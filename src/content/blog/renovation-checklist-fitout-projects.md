## Introduction

In interior construction, **renovations** often demand more attention to detail than new builds. Constraints like limited space, working around existing structures, and coordinating multiple trades require a supervisor’s full attention and a clear process.

That’s where a solid renovation checklist becomes an indispensable site management tool.

Whether you're managing a commercial office fit-out, retail refurbishment, or residential remodeling, this guide provides a step-by-step breakdown of the key tasks for successful project delivery.

## Pre-Renovation Planning

Before anyone lifts a tool, careful preparation is essential.

- ✅ Conduct a site inspection and assess existing conditions  
- ✅ Define scope and expectations with the client  
- ✅ Prepare measurements and reference photos  
- ✅ Set a budget (include 10–20% contingency)  
- ✅ Create a milestone-based project schedule  
- ✅ Identify permit or compliance requirements  
- ✅ Finalize design drawings, BOQs, and contract documents  
- ✅ Confirm suppliers and labor availability

---

## Site Preparation

Once planning is complete, prepare the site for controlled execution:

- ✅ Protect retained finishes or equipment  
- ✅ Set up hoarding, warning signs, and access control  
- ✅ Disconnect or reroute electrical, plumbing, and HVAC lines  
- ✅ Clear furniture, old fittings, and debris  
- ✅ Confirm safety compliance and emergency procedures  
- ✅ Notify neighbors or other tenants if applicable

---

## Demolition Works

Safe, precise demolition sets the tone for quality execution:

- ✅ Match demo zones with architectural drawings  
- ✅ Isolate electrical and plumbing before cutting  
- ✅ Remove tiles, partitions, ceilings, and fittings carefully  
- ✅ Sort debris for disposal or reuse  
- ✅ Report any hidden damage or site surprises  
- ✅ Clean and prepare surfaces for next phase

---

## Structural and MEP Works

Once open, it’s time to handle critical infrastructure:

- ✅ Reinforce structural elements if required  
- ✅ Install new plumbing, electrical conduits, and AC ducting  
- ✅ Waterproof all wet areas (bathrooms, kitchens)  
- ✅ Conduct first fix inspections before enclosing services  
- ✅ Update redline drawings for any changes in routing  
- ✅ Coordinate services to avoid clashes (e.g. pipes vs. lighting)

---

## Wall, Ceiling, and Floor Finishes

The visible part of your renovation begins to take shape here:

- ✅ Install gypsum board partitions or block walls  
- ✅ Construct ceiling framework and board installation  
- ✅ Apply floor leveling or screed  
- ✅ Lay floor finishes (tiles, vinyl, laminate, carpet)  
- ✅ Paint and decorate walls and ceilings  
- ✅ Maintain alignment with interior design intent

---

## Fixtures and Final Finishes

The last 10% often takes 50% of the effort — details matter here:

- ✅ Fix light switches, sockets, and lights  
- ✅ Install WCs, basins, taps, and other sanitary fixtures  
- ✅ Fit kitchen cabinets, wardrobes, or shelves  
- ✅ Mount doors, handles, locks, and trims  
- ✅ Apply final paint touch-ups and clean finishes  
- ✅ Prepare the space for snagging and client inspection

---

## Testing and Handover

Deliver a complete, functional, and clean space:

- ✅ Test lighting, water pressure, and electrical points  
- ✅ Ensure air conditioning runs as expected  
- ✅ Check for leaks, alignment, and gaps in finishes  
- ✅ Prepare a snag list and rectify outstanding issues  
- ✅ Deep clean the site before client handover  
- ✅ Submit as-built drawings, manuals, and warranties  
- ✅ Conduct final walkthrough with client and sign off
