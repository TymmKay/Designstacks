## Introduction

When it comes to interior finishes, the look and feel of a painted surface matters just as much as the color itself. Whether you're working on a high-end commercial fit-out or a residential home, specifying the right gloss level is critical. The **Gloss or Sheen Test** helps ensure that the final finish reflects the intended aesthetic and functional quality.

## What Is a Gloss or Sheen Test?

The gloss test measures how much **light reflects** off a painted surface. This reflection determines whether a finish appears **matte, satin, semi-gloss, or glossy**.

A device called a **gloss meter** is used to shine light at a specific angle—typically 60°, 20°, or 85°—and measure the reflected light in **Gloss Units (GU)**.

## Gloss Level Chart

| Gloss Units (GU) | Appearance Type     |
|------------------|---------------------|
| 0–10 GU          | Matte / Flat        |
| 10–40 GU         | Satin / Eggshell    |
| 40–70 GU         | Semi-gloss          |
| 70+ GU           | High-gloss          |

## When to Use This Test on Site

You might use gloss testing in the following scenarios:

- Ensuring **painted gypsum partitions** match client expectations  
- **Approving cabinet or door finishes** on handover  
- Resolving disputes on **“wrong paint finish”** claims  
- Maintaining **consistency across batches** of painted surfaces

## Pro Tips for Site Supervisors

- Always **request manufacturer gloss specs** when approving paint.  
- For high-end fitouts, perform a **mock-up test and get client sign-off**.  
- Gloss differences are more noticeable under **natural lighting**, so check in daylight when possible.  

## Conclusion

The gloss test may seem minor, but it can make or break the perceived quality of your finish. By understanding how to measure and interpret gloss levels, you’ll deliver projects that meet both technical and visual expectations—keeping clients satisfied and ensuring consistency on site.
